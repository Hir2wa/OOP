 as  we work on the  trying to  understang exception in java   is  essatioal  to try to understand  just 3 thinngs  compiler runtime error and logical errors    
 let takae a simple example bu using these simple one  right   
 by making declaration using  string x = 4;
 system.out.println(x);
 wee will get a  compiler error  why   (we all know that we write S  by capital letter )
 ex2: buy taking 
  int x=7;
  int y= 0;
  int z = x/y;
  system.out.println(z)
  // we geet aritmetic error  // whyyyyyy we get out but we get error 
  these is a logical error i think so //



  other example is simple here
